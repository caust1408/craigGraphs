Homework for topographical sorting
We were required to create a dataset of our own and then sort it accordingly.
My dataset was over making coffee and the steps required.
Going into testGraph.js you can change the dataset to reflect a dataset of your choosing.  This program runs with d8 and then select the testGraph.js file.
